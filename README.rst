UrlSnippet
===========

This repository contains a REST service for requesting text snippets from a given url. The primary GET method requires the user to input two parameters, url and max_age. The first time the service is called with a given URL, it will fetch the supplied URL and extract the text. But if it is called on a URL that has been used before and the last cached page is less than max_age seconds old, it will return the cached copy. URL snippets are persisted via the python requests_cache and sqlite backend, so if your service restarts, you donâ€™t have to fetch everything again.
